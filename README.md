This project involves designing and implementing a relational database in MySQL to replicate core Instagram functionalities. 
The database models key features like user accounts, posts, comments, likes, and follower relationships, based on concepts from Colt Steeleâ€™s "The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp".

Key Features:

Users: Stores user information (id, username, email, password, profile picture, etc.).
Posts: Tracks user posts (id, user_id, caption, image_url, etc.).
Comments: Stores comments on posts (id, post_id, user_id, comment_text, etc.).
Likes: Tracks likes on posts (id, post_id, user_id).
Followers: Manages follower-following relationships between users.
Database Design:
One-to-Many: Users to Posts, Posts to Comments, Posts to Likes.
Many-to-Many: Users to Users (via Followers table for follower-following relationships).
The database ensures data integrity through normalized structures, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
